This project implements the deadlock avoidance algorithm called Banker's Algorithm. 

Banker's algorithm can be run by executing bankersAlgoRunner or if you do any changes to any of the source files, than you can compile the bankersAlgoRunner.c and then execute the created executable. 

This project was developed using VSCode Text Editor and Ubuntu Platform. But the executable in this repository is for Windows and will probably work only on windows.

If you find compatibility issues with the exectable, then open the directory in the terminal such that the present working directory contains the source file bankersAlgoRunner.c. Then enter the following command:
gcc -o bankersAlgoRunner bankersAlgoRunner.c

To run the executable through terminal. Open the directory in the terminal such that the present working directory contains the executable bankersAlgoRunner. Then enter enter the following command:
./bankersAlgoRunner
